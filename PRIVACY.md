# Privacy Policy

**BT Device Tray**
Last updated: February 16, 2026

## Overview

BT Device Tray is a local system tray utility for managing Bluetooth device connections and monitoring battery levels on Windows. This application operates entirely on your device and does not collect, transmit, or store any personal information.

## Data Collection

BT Device Tray does **not** collect, store, or share any personal data. Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No usage data or analytics are gathered
- No data is transmitted to external servers
- No cookies or tracking technologies are used
- No accounts or sign-ins are required

## Data Stored Locally

The only data the application accesses is:

- **Bluetooth device information** (device names, connection status, battery levels) queried from the Windows operating system in real time. This data is held in memory only while the app is running and is never saved to disk or transmitted.
- **A single registry entry** (`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`) is created only if you enable the "Run on startup" option. This entry contains the application's file path and can be removed by disabling the option.

## Third-Party Services

BT Device Tray does not integrate with any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs that collect data.

## Children's Privacy

Since no data is collected from any user, no data is collected from children.

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected in this document with an updated date.
